						<h1>Multithreaded Dictionary Attack</h1>
						<p class="content-paragraph">
						This was the first project for my Concepts of Parallel and Distributed Systems class. This program (written in Java) carries out a dictionary attack in order to crack the passwords of a theoretical website that had their hashed passwords stolen. The idea is that a website, who hashes their passwords with 100000 executions of SHA-256, has had their hashed passwords and corresponding usernames stolen. My program attempts to find the string that hashes to each of the stolen hashes. The design of the program is as follows:
						</p>
						<p class="content-paragraph">
						There are two types of threads, Group 1 and Group 2. The job of the Group 1 threads is to take a string from a file containing a number of common passwords and hash it using the same algorithm as the target website, and store it in a synchronized hash table. The Group 2 threads are given one of the stolen hashes and checks if it is in the synchronized hash table. If it is in the hash table, the thread prints out the username and its corresponding plaintext password. 
						</p>
						<p class="content-paragraph">
						The key was to make sure that the hash table shared by all of the threads was synchronized, so that no two threads could enter the critical sections at the same time. This ended up being fairly simple to implement in Java. I made a wrapper class for a Java HashMap that had two methods of interest, <span class="monospace">put()</span> and <span class="monospace">get()</span>. Both have the synchronized keyword, preventing more than one thread from entering each method at the same time. <span class="monospace">put()</span> calls <span class="monospace">notifyAll()</span> after putting the hash and username into the HashMap, and <span class="monospace">get()</span> waits while the HashMap is empty or contains fewer than the maximum number of elements.

						<h1>My Interactive Shell</h1>
						<p class="content-paragraph">
						MISH is a fairly simple interactive UNIX shell implemented in C 
						using the fork/exec pattern. It has a number of internal commands
						that are handled by the shell itself, and any other command is dispatched
						to the path and executed by the machine. If the command cannot be found 
						or some other error occurs, the user is notified and execution continues
						if it was not a fatal error. <br><br>

						The internal commands include: <br>
						verbose {on/off}:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns verbose mode on or off. Verbose mode displays valuable information about<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each command as it executes (command name, token list, process ID)<br><br>

						help:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays all available internal commands.<br><br>

						history:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays all commands that have been executed in this instance of MISH.<br><br>

						quit:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gracefully exits the program.<br><br>

						To launch from the command line:<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mish {0/1} // 0 defaults verbose mode to on, 1 to off.<br><br>

						First, the program handles the command line args, turning verbose mode on or 
						off accordingly. Then, it enters the main control loop. In the loop, it first 
						processes the user input by parsing it into a list of tokens. Then it checks 
						if the command was an internal command, responding appropriatley if it was. 
						If not, the system assumes it was an external command and forks, creating a 
						new process, and the child process calls execvp on the command. 
						I used a top-down approach to the design of the program, starting with the 
						user input and basic control loop, adding funtionality piece-by-piece (saving 
						the annoying parts for last...) The source is below.
