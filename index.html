					<h2>I code. I row.</h2>

						I am a computer science major at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am also a varsity rower. 90% of the time, I will either be typing away at my laptop or have an oar in my hand. I always try my absolute hardest to overcome any hardship, adversity, or obstacle that is thrown at me, be it in the classroom or on the water. I am in my second year at RIT, and am on track to graduate a semester early in the winter of 2016. My current areas of interest in computer science and programming mostly lie on the lower level and the back-end. I enjoy the challenge involved in working closer to the hardware. I mostly just enjoy the problem-solving aspects of programming and software design in general, but my UI design skills aren't fantastic so I tend to stick to the back-end. Also, in my experience, the more interesting problems tend to exist where I am dealing with data rather than the user.

						I first fell in love with programming in high school, somewhat against my will. I had an extra block in my schedule and was stuck into Computer Programming 1, taught using QuickBASIC, a language that has hardly seen an update since 1988. I tried my best to switch out of the class, but the scheduling gods had other plans and I was stuck there. As I muddled my way through the decades-old software that we were forced to use, I quickly realized that not only was I pretty good at this programming thing, but I actually <em>enjoyed</em> it! I finished off that class by writing a very shoddy PONG clone, where the ball would sometimes decide to just go right through the paddle. After that class, I decided to take my programming journey into my own hands. The following summer, I got a copy of <em>Head First Java</em>, by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates and read it cover to cover, going through all of the example programs and programming puzzles. By the end, I felt fairly comfortable with Java and object-oriented programming. The following school year, I decided that my high school's programming classes didn't really suit my needs or interests, so I took a class in Java and O-O programming at Amherst College in Amherst, MA. My professor there further strengthened my feelings towards programming and computer science in general. At that time, in the winter of my senior year, I was applying for college and deciding what I wanted to do with my life. It was pretty clear to me at that point that I wanted to go into computer science. The rest, as it were, is history.

						My time as a rower didn't start until I got to RIT. I was a swimmer in high school, but didn't really want to spend any more time in a highly chlorinated pool than I had too. So I was walking down the quarter mile one day and saw a sign advertising an informational meeting about the novice rowing team. No experience required! I had heard before that I might be good at rowing because of my height, so I decided to check it out. I joined the novice team a week later. My whole freshman year, I was in the top novice boat, in which we went undefeated in the regular season and placed second at States. I experienced pain and soreness the like of which I had never experienced before. I met my best friends in the world. I learned accountability, responsibility, and to never back down from a challenge. I came back at the beginning of this year a varsity rower. In the fall, I competed in the top varsity boat, earning three medals at large regattas. I am currently about to start my first spring racing season as a varsity rower, and have never been more ready to face the competition.
